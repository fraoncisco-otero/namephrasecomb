Throw out the used paper cup and plate.
Tight curls get limp on rainy days.
Tin cans are absent from store shelves.
We find joy in the simplest things.
What joy there is in living
When you hear the bell, come quickly.
You cannot brew tea in a cold pot.
A clean neck means a neat collar
A cramp is no small danger on a swim
A gold ring will please most any girl
A king ruled the state in the early days
A man in a blue sweater sat at the desk
A pencil with black lead writes best
A plea for funds seems to come again
A pod is what peas always grow in
A yacht slid around the point into the bay
Acid burns holes in wool cloth
Dots of light betrayed the black cat
Every word and phrase he speaks is true
Feed the white mouse some flower seeds
Fill the ink jar with sticky glue
Hang tinsel from both branches
He wrote down a long list of items
Heave the line over the port side
Hoist the load to your left shoulder
Hurdle the pit with the aid of a long pole
It is a band of steel three inches wide
It takes a lot of help to finish these
Most of the news is easy for us to hear
Nine rows of soldiers stood in a line
Nudge gently but wake her now
Oak is strong and also gives shade
On the islands the sea breeze is soft and mild
Open your book to the first page
Paint the sockets in the wall dull green
Pour the stew from the pot into the plate
Press the pedal with your left foot
Seed is needed to plant the spring corn
Shake the dust from your shoes, stranger
Ship maps are different from those for planes
Slide the box into that empty space
Steam hissed from the broken valve
Stop whistling and watch the boys march
Tear a thin sheet from the yellow pad
The bark of the pine tree was shiny and dark
The birch canoe slid on the smooth planks
The boy was there when the sun rose
The brown house was on fire to the attic
The cement had dried when he moved it
The dark pot hung in the front closet
The empty flask stood on the tin tray
The frosty air passed through the coat
The fruit of a fig tree is apple shaped
The goose was brought straight from the old market
The horse trotted around the field at a brisk pace
The jacket hung on the back of the wide chair
The kite flew wildly in the high wind
The little tales they tell are false
The music played on while they talked
The mute muffled the high tones of the horn
The Navy attacked the big task force
The ram scared the school children off
The rarest spice comes from the far East
The shelves were bare of both jam or crackers
The slush lay deep along the street
The small pup gnawed a hole in the sock
The small red neon lamp went out
The steady drip is worse than a drenching rain
The store walls were lined with colored frocks
The store was jammed before the sale could start
The way to save money is not to spend much
The young kid jumped the rusty gate
They slice the sausage thin with a knife
This horse will nose his way to the finish
Those last words were a strong statement
Try to have the court decide the case
Type out three lists of orders
We talked of the side show in the circus
Yell and clap as the curtain slides back
A cruise in warm waters in a sleek yacht is fun
A flat pack takes less luggage space
A fur muff is stylish once more
A joy to every child is the swan boat
A lathe cuts and trims any wood
A rod is used to catch pink salmon
A siege will crack the strong defense
A speedy man can beat this track mark
A strong bid may scare your partner stiff
A wisp of cloud hung in the blue air
At that high level the air is pure
Cap the jar with a tight brass cover
Carry the pail to the wall and spill it there
Cats and Dogs each hate the other
Clams are small, round, soft, and tasty
Coax a young calf to drink from a bucket
Corn cobs can be used to kindle a fire
Dimes showered down from all sides
Dispense with a vest on a day like this
Draw the chart with heavy black lines
Each penny shone like new
Fairy tales should be fun to write
Find the twin who stole the pearl necklace
Fish evade the net and swim off
Glue the sheet to the dark blue background
Guess the result from the first scores
He lent his coat to the tall gaunt stranger
He put his last cartridge into the gun and fired
He said the same phrase thirty times
He smoke a big pipe with strong contents
He used the lathe to make brass objects
He wrote his name boldly at the top of the sheet
It was a bad error on the part of the new judge
Jerk that dart from the cork target
Jerk the cord, and out tumbles the gold
Leaves turn brown and yellow in the fall
Mark the spot with a sign painted red
Neat plans fail without luck
Oats are a food eaten by horse and man
Put the chart on the mantel and tack it down
See the cat glaring at the scared mouse
She was kind to sick old people
Shut the hatch before the waves push it in
Take the winding path to reach the lake
The beach is dry and shallow at low tide
The bloom of the rose lasts a few days
The child almost hurt the small dog
The child crawled into the dense grass
The couch cover and hall drapes were blue
The crooked maze failed to fool the mouse
The door was barred, locked, and bolted as well
The dry wax protects the deep scratch
The fish twisted and turned on the bent hook
The gold ring fits only a pierced ear
The harder he tried the less he got done
The long journey home took a year
The loss of the second ship was hard to take
The lure is used to catch trout and flounder
The news struck doubt into restless minds
The peace league met to discuss their plans
The pipe ran almost the length of the ditch
The plant grew large and green in the window
The play began as soon as we sat down
The roof should be tilted at a sharp slant
The ship was torn apart on the sharp reef
The sink is the thing in which we pile dishes
The team with the best timing looks good
The thaw came early and freed the stream
The two met while playing on the sand
They are men who walk the middle of the road
They are pushed back each time they attack
Use a pencil to write the first draft
A gray mare walked before the colt
A pound of sugar costs more than eggs
A salt pickle tastes fine with ham
A smatter of French is worse than none
A streak of color ran down the left edge
A whiff of it will cure the most stubborn cold
Adding fast leads to wrong sums
All sat frozen and watched the screen
Both brothers wear the same size
Bribes fail where honest men work
Cut the cord that binds the box tightly
Dill pickles are sour but taste fine
Dip the pail once and let it settle
Drop the two when you add the figures
Eight miles of woodland burned to waste
Even a just cause needs power to win
Float the soap on top of the bath water
Grape juice and water mix well
Green ice frosted the punch bowl
He broke a new shoelace that day
He broke his ties with groups of former friends
He picked up the dice for a second roll
He ran half way to the hardware store
He took the lead and kept it the whole distance
It was hidden from sight by a mass of leaves and shrubs
It's a dense crowd in two distinct ways
It's easy to tell the depth of a well
No cement will hold hard wood
Note closely the size of the gas tank
Once we stood beside the shore
One step more and the board will collapse
Pluck the bright rose without leaves
Press the pants and sew a button on the vest
Ripe pears are fit for a queen's table
Schools for ladies teach charm and grace
She saw a cat in the neighbor's house
Sickness kept him home the third week
Slide the tray across the glass top
Take two shares as a fair profit
The beam dropped down on the workman's head
The black trunk fell from the landing
The boss ran the show with a watchful eye
The boy owed his pal thirty cents
The bunch of grapes was pressed into wine
The fan whirled its round blades softly
The farmer swapped his horse for a brown ox
The fly made its way along the wall
The idea is to sew both edges straight
The ink stain dried on the finished page
The man went to the woods to gather sticks
The night shift men rate extra pay
The odor of spring makes young hearts jump
The old pan was covered with hard fudge
The pennant waved when the wind blew
The pipe began to rust while new
The poor boy missed the boat again
The rise to fame of a person takes luck
The source of the huge river is the clear spring
The square wooden crate was packed to be shipped
The stems of the tall glasses cracked and broke
The tin box held priceless stones
The train brought our hero to the big town
The vane on top of the pole revolved in the wind
Their eyelids droop for want of sleep
There are more than two factors here
There is a strong chance it will happen once more
There was a sound of dry leaves outside
They sang the same tunes at each party
They took their kids from the public school
This will lead the world to more sound and fury
We need grain to keep our mules healthy
Where were they when the noise started
A big wet stain was on the round carpet
A blue crane is a tall wading bird
A chink in the wall allowed a draft to blow
A cloud of dust stung his tender eyes
A filing case is now hard to buy
A pink shell was found on the sandy beach
A sip of tea revives his tired friend
A stuffed chair slipped from the moving van
Add salt before you fry the egg
Be sure to set that lamp firmly in the hole
Breakfast buns are fine with a hot drink
Crack the walnut with your sharp side teeth
Do that with a wooden stick
Down that road is the way to the grain farmer
Drive the screw straight into the wood
He sent the figs, but kept the ripe cherries
His hip struck the knee of the next player
In some form or other we need fun
It was done before the boy could see it
Kick the ball straight and follow through
Mince pie is a dish served to children
Open the crate but don't break the glass
Pack the records in a neat thin case
Paper is scarce, so write with much care
Peep under the tent and see the clowns
Pink clouds floated with the breeze
Roads are paved with sticky tar
Sit on the perch and tell the others what to do
Split the log with a quick, sharp blow
Take the match and strike it against your shoe
The bank pressed for payment of the debt
The chap slipped into the crowd and was lost
The clock struck to mark the third period
The cloud moved in a stately way and was gone
The coffee stand is too high for the couch
The cup cracked and spilled its contents
The dirt piles were lines along the road
The duke left the park in a silver coach
The dusty bench stood by the stone wall
The facts don't always show who is right
The fin was sharp and cut the clear water
The fur of cats goes by many names
The hat brim was wide and too droopy
The just claim got the right verdict
The key you designed will fit the lock
The kitten chased the dog down the street
The lamp shone with a steady green flame
The line where the edges join was clean
The mule trod the treadmill day and night
The paper box is full of thumb tacks
The red paper brightened the dim stage
The red tape bound the smuggled food
The show was a flop from the very start
The sky in the west is tinged with orange red
The sky that morning was clear and bright blue
The swan dive was far short of perfect
The third act was dull and tired the players
The wall phone rang loud and often
The walled town was seized without a fight
The weight of the package was seen on the high scale
The wide road shimmered in the hot sun
These coins will be needed to pay his debt
These days a chicken leg is a rare dish
They floated on the raft to sun their white backs
Trample the spark, else the flames will spread
Two plus seven is less than ten
Watch the log float in the wide river
We are sure that one war is enough
We need an end of all such matter
We now have a new base for shipping
Will you please answer that phone
Wipe the grease off his dirty face
A fresh start will work such wonders
A list of names is carved around the base
A saw is a tool used for making boards
A small creek cut across the field
A steep trail is painful for our feet
A young child should not suffer fright
Add the sum to the product of these three
An abrupt start does not win the prize
Bottles hold four kinds of rum
Breathe deep and smell the piny air
Burn peat after the logs give out
Crouch before you jump or miss the mark
Either mud or dust are found at all times
Fake stones shine but cost little
Fasten two pins on each side
Gray paint stretched for miles around
Greet the new guests and leave quickly
Hats are worn to tea and not to dinner
He offered proof in the form of a large chart
Help the woman get back to her feet
Keep the hatch tight and the watch constant
Light maple makes for a swell room
Live wires should be kept covered
Look in the corner to find the tan shirt
Mend the coat before you go out
North winds bring colds and fevers
Pages bound in cloth make a book
Paste can cleanse the most dirty brass
Pick a card and slip it under the pack
Plead to the council to free the poor thief
Rice is often served in round bowls
See the player scoot to third base
Sell your gift to a buyer at a good gain
She danced like a swan, tall and graceful
She flaps her cape as she parades the street
Small children came to see him
The aim of the contest is to raise a great fund
The beauty of the view stunned the young boy
The big red apple fell to the ground
The case was puzzling to the old and wise
The clan gathered on each dull night
The clothes dried on a thin wooden rack
The crunch of feet in the snow was the only sound
The glow deepened in the eyes of the sweet girl
The hilt of the sword was carved with fine designs
The hinge on the door creaked with old age
The kite dipped and swayed, but stayed aloft
The lawyer tried to lose his case
The lazy cow lay in the cool grass
The leaf drifts along with a slow spin
The lease ran out in sixteen weeks
The logs fell and tumbled into the clear stream
The map had an X that meant nothing
The nag pulled the frail cart along
The node on the stalk of wheat grew daily
The play seems dull and quite stupid
The pods of peas ferment in bare fields
The pot boiled but the contents failed to jell
The prince ordered his head chopped off
The quick fox jumped on the sleeping cat
The rush for funds reached its peak Tuesday
The stale smell of old beer lingers
The stitch will serve but needs to be shortened
The theft of the pearl pin was kept secret
The urge to write short stories is rare
There are many ways to do these things
They took the axe and the saw to the forest
Those thistles bend in a high wind
To reach the end he needs much courage
Torn scraps littered the stone floor
Wake and rise, and step into the green outdoors
We dress to suit the weather of most days
A cold dip restores health and zest
A pot of tea helps to pass the evening
A round hole was drilled through the thin board
A round mat will cover the dull spot
A tame squirrel makes a nice pet
A thin book fits in the side pocket
Add the column and put the sum here
Bail the boat to stop it from sinking
Better hash is made of rare beef
Bring your problems to the wise chief
Cars and busses stalled in snow drifts
Cheap clothes are flashy but don't last
He asks no person to vouch for him
He ordered peach pie with ice cream
It matters not if he reads these words or those
Just hoist it up and take it away
Let it burn, it gives us warmth and comfort
Lift the square stone over the fence
Pack the kits and don't forget the salt
Pure bred poodles have curls
Send the stuff in a thick paper bag
Set the piece here and say nothing
Sever the twine with a quick snip of the knife
Shake hands with this friendly child
Shape the clay gently into block form
Slide the bill between the two leaves
Smile when you say nasty words
Sunday is the best part of the week
The ancient coin was quite dull and worn
The baby puts his right foot in his mouth
The best method is to fix it in place with clips
The birch looked stark white and lonesome
The bright lanterns were gay on the dark lawn
The club rented the rink for the fifth night
The cold drizzle will halt the bond drive
The copper bowl shone in the sun's rays
The curtain rose and the show was on
The desk was firm on the shaky floor
The drip of the rain made a pleasant sound
The early phase of life moves fast
The grass and bushes were wet with dew
The grass curled around the fence post
The green light in the brown box flickered
The heap of fallen leaves was set on fire
The horse balked and threw the tall rider
The houses are built of red clay bricks
The juice of lemons makes fine punch
The large house had hot water taps
The loss of the cruiser was a blow to the fleet
The man wore a feather in his felt hat
The nozzle of the fire hose was bright brass
The pencils have all been used
The pleasant hours fly by much too soon
The ramp led up to the wide highway
The rude laugh filled the empty room
The screen before the fire kept in the sparks
The sheep were led home by a dog
The slang word for raw whiskey is booze
The tongs lay beside the ice pail
The tube was blown and the tire flat and useless
The wagon moved on well oiled wheels
The wrist was badly strained and hung limp
Thieves who rob friends deserve jail
To send it now in large amounts is bad
Try to trace the fine lines of the painting
Tuck the sheet under the edge of the mat
Turn out the lantern which gives us light
Twist the valve and release hot steam
Two blue fish swam in the tank
When the frost has come it is time for turkey
Whitings are small fish caught in nets
Wood is best for making toys and blocks
A bowl of rice is free with chicken stew
A brown leather bag hung from its strap
A castle built from sand fails to endure
A force equal to that would move the earth
A quart of milk is water for the most part
A ridge on a smooth surface is a bump or flaw
A ripe plum is fit for a king's palate
A thing of small note can cause despair
After the dance, they went straight home
Beat the dust from the rug onto the lawn
Boards will warp unless kept dry
Cut the pie into large parts
Ducks fly north but lack a compass
Dull stories make her laugh
Fly by night and you waste little time
Footprints showed the path he took up the beach
Go now and come here later
Green moss grows on the northern side
He takes the oath of office each March
He wheeled the bike past the winding road
Her purse was full of useless trash
High seats are best for football fans
If you mumble your speech will be lost
It caught its hind paw in a rusty trap
It is hard to erase blue or red ink
It is late morning on the old wall clock
It takes heat to bring out the odor
Loop the braid to the left and then over
Many hands help get the job done
March the soldiers past the next hill
Nine men were hired to dig the ruins
Paper will dry out when wet
Screw the round cap on as tight as needed
Smoke poured out of every crack
Smoky fires lack flame and heat
Some ads serve to cheat buyers
Sweet words work better than fierce
The blind man counted his old coins
The bombs left most of the town in ruins
The box is held by a bright red snapper
The box was thrown beside the parked truck
The brass tube circled the high wall
The cleat sank deeply into the soft turf
The doctor cured him with these pills
The first part of the plan needs changing
The gloss on top made it unfit to read
The hitch between the horse and cart broke
The horn of the car woke the sleeping cop
The office paint was a dull, sad tan
The petals fall with the next puff of wind
The pirates seized the crew of the lost ship
The ripe taste of cheese improves with age
The room was crowded with a wild mob
The rope will bind the seven books at once
The set of china hit the floor with a crash
The shaky barn fell with a loud crash
The square peg will settle in the round hole
The stray cat gave birth to kittens
The term ended in late june that year
The tree top waved in a graceful way
The vamp of the shoe had a gold buckle
The vast space stretched into the far distance
The young prince became heir to the throne
There is a fine hard tang in salty air
This plank was made for walking on 
Three for a dime, the young peddler cried
We admire and love a good cook
We don't get much money but we have fun
Weave the carpet on the right hand side
Women form less than half of the group
Write a fond note to the friend you cherish
Write fast if you want to finish early
A child's wit saved the day for us
A cup of sugar makes sweet fudge
A good book informs of what we ought to know
A rich farm is rare in this sandy waste
A sash of gold silk will trim her dress
A severe storm tore down the barn
A stiff cord will do to fasten your shoe
A thin stripe runs down the middle
A toad and a frog are hard to tell apart
A Tusk is used to make costly gifts
Act on these orders with great speed
At night the alarm roused him from a deep sleep
Beef is scarcer than some lamb
Bring your best compass to the third class
Clothes and lodging are free to new men
Cod is the main business of the north shore
Drop the ashes on the worn old rug
Fine soap saves tender skin
Flood the mails with requests for this book
Fruit flavors are used in fizz drinks
He knew the skill of the great young actress
He sent the boy on a short errand
Hedge apples may stain your hands green
Hemp is a weed found in parts of the tropics
His shirt was clean but one button was gone
Hop over the fence and plunge in
Jazz and swing fans like fast music
Jerk the rope and the bell rings weakly
Let's all join as we sing the last chorus
Men strive but seldom get rich
Our plans right now are hazy
Pile the coal high in the shed corner
Plead with the lawyer to drop the lost cause
Say it slowly but make it ring clear
Serve the hot rum to the tired heroes
She was waiting at my front lawn
Slide the catch back and open the desk
Stop and stare at the hard working man
Tea in thin china has a sweet taste
Tea served from the brown jug is tasty
The bills were mailed promptly on the tenth of the month
The colt reared and threw the tall rider
The hail pattered on the burnt brown grass
The heart beat strongly and with firm strokes
The hogs were fed chopped corn and garbage
The hostess taught the new maid to serve
The junk yard had a mouldy smell
The lake sparkled in the red hot sun
The lobes of her ears were pierced to hold rings
The new girl was fired today at noon
The plush chair leaned against the wall
The sand drifts over the sills of the old house
The sense of smell is better than that of touch
The smell of burned rags itches my nose
The soft cushion broke the man's fall
The spot on the blotter was made by green ink
The water in this well is a source of good health
The wharf could be seen at the farther shore
The young girl gave no clear response
The youth drove with zest, but little skill
The zones merge in the central part of town
There the flood mark is ten inches
They told wild tales to frighten him
Thick glasses helped him read the print
This is a grand season for hikes on the road
This strong arm shall shield your honor
Time brings us many changes
To make pure ice, you freeze water
We don't like to admit our small faults
We like to see clear weather
We tried to replace the coin but failed
Write at once or you may forget it
A dash of pepper spoils beef stew
A gem in the rough needs work to polish
A gold vase is both rare and costly
A lame back kept his score low
A rag will soak up spilled water
A six comes up more often than a ten
A thick coat of black paint covered all
A vent near the edge brought in fresh air
A waxed floor makes us lose balance
A white silk jacket goes with any shoes
Always close the barn door tight
Birth and death marks the limits of life
Brass rings are sold by these natives
Calves thrive on tender spring grass
Feel the heat of the weak dying flame
Five years he lived with a shaggy dog
Four hours of steady work faced us
Get the trust fund to the bank early
Glass will clink when struck by metal
He carved a head from the round block of marble
He crawled with care along the ledge
He wrote his last novel there at the inn
Help the weak to preserve their strength
His wide grin earned many friends
Hold the hammer near the end to drive the nail
It snowed, rained, and hailed the same morning
Leave now and you will arrive on time
Much of the story makes good sense
Mud was spattered on the front of his white shirt
New pants lack cuffs and pockets
No doubt about the way the wind blows
No hardship seemed to make him sad
Pitch the straw through the door of the stable
Place a rosebush near the porch steps
Poached eggs and tea must suffice
Quench your thirst, then eat the crackers
Raise the sail and steer the ship northward
Rake the rubbish up and then burn it
Read just what the meter says
Seven seals were stamped on great sheets
She blushed when he gave her a white orchid
She called his name many times
She sewed the torn coat quite neatly
Soap can wash most dirt away
Tack the strip of carpet to the worn floor
Take shelter in this tent, but keep still
Ten pins were set in order
The barrel of beer was a brew of malt and hops
The desk and both chairs were painted tan
The doorknob was made of bright clean brass
The dune rose from the edge of the water
The first worm gets snapped early
The flint sputtered and lit a pine torch
The friendly gang left the drug store
The hog crawled under the high fence
The last switch cannot be turned off
The mail comes in three batches per day
The meal was cooked before the bell rang
The pearl was worn in a thin silver ring
The point of the steel pen was bent and twisted
The purple tie was ten years old
The salt breeze came across from the sea
The slab was hewn from heavy blocks of slate
The straw nest housed five robins
The streets are narrow and full of sharp turns
The three story house was built of stone
The work of the tailor is seen on each side
These pills do less good than others
They could laugh although they were sad
They felt gay when the ship arrived in port
To have is better than to wait and hope
We frown when events take a bad turn
A break in the dam almost caused a flood
A cone costs five cents on Mondays
A fence cuts through the corner lot
A large size in stockings is hard to sell
A shower of dirt fell from the hot pipes
A sullen smile gets few friends
A zestful food is the hot-cross bun
Add the store's account to the last cent
Bad nerves are jangled by a door slam
Bathe and relax in the cool green grass
Both lost their lives in the raging storm
Canned pears lack full flavor
Choose between the high road and the low
Code is used when secrets are sent
Dig deep in the earth for pirate's gold
Dunk the stale biscuits into strong drink
Even the worst will beat his low score
Farmers came in to thresh the oat crop
Fill your pack with bright trinkets for the poor
Flax makes a fine brand of paper
Grace makes up for lack of beauty
He lay prone and hardly moved a limb
In the rear of the ground floor was a large passage
It takes a good trap to capture a bear
Jump the fence and hurry up the bank
Lush ferns grow on the lofty rocks
Madam, this is the best brand of corn
Men think and plan and sometimes act
Mesh wire keeps chicks inside
Move the vat over the hot fire
Next Sunday is the twelfth of the month
Next Tuesday we must vote
Our troops are set to strike heavy blows
Port is a strong wine with a smoky taste
Post no bills on this office wall
Prod the old mule with a crooked stick
Read verse out loud for pleasure
Screen the porch with woven straw mats
She has a smart way of wearing clothes
Slash the gold cloth into fine ribbons
Soak the cloth and drown the sharp odor
Take a chance and win a china doll
Tend the sheep while the dog wanders
That guy is the writer of a few banned books
That move means the game is over
The beetle droned in the hot June sun
The bill was paid every third week
The chair looked strong but had no bottom
The cigar burned a hole in the desk top
The corner store was robbed last night
The fight will end in just six minutes
The fruit peel was cut in thick slices
The girl at the booth sold fifty bonds
The knife was hung inside its bright sheath
The latch on the back gate needed a nail
The marsh will freeze when cold enough
The pencil was cut to be sharp at both ends
The price is fair for a good antique clock
The pup jerked the leash as he saw a feline shape
The sofa cushion is red and of light weight
The sun came up to light the eastern sky
The tiny girl took off her hat
The wreck occurred by the bank on Main Street
There is a lag between thought and act
Those words were the cue for the actor to leave
Throw out the used paper cup and plate
Tight curls get limp on rainy days
Tin cans are absent from store shelves
We find joy in the simplest things
What joy there is in living
When you hear the bell, come quickly
You cannot brew tea in a cold pot
a clean neck means a neat collar
